📌 MOTIVATION 
While 2020  statistics show that approximately 10,000 Korean citizens struggle with Tourette Syndrome, a nervous system disorder that causes involuntary movement and unwanted sounds, only one patient was officially registered as handicapped. 
Particularly focusing on patients under the age of 18, many children during their developing years struggle with the stigmatization of the disorder due to the lack of awareness. 
In the era of COVID-19 where digital applications are highly accessible at a low cost. iTourette is a digitized software based on programming knowledge and skills. 
Applications allow more interaction than videos and greater accessibility than webpages, which contributed to the decision to develop software. The motivation of using the easily downloadable application was to raise awareness and improve the concentration levels of children diagnosed with the illness in South Korea.

📌 COLOR SCHEME 
🟢 Main Color: Green
The color green relaxes tension in the eye and evokes calmness in the brain, improving decision-making skills. The triggers that stimulate Tourette Syndrome conditions are bullying and external stress. For children diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome, green will help rational thinking and increase concentration. 

⚪️ Base Color: White 
The color white evokes positive thought and emotional control. The clean hue without any disturbance in pigmentation allows clear thought processes in children. In addition, white creates a sense of space and purity. As the target users are children, representing purity seemed apt for the color scheme.

🟣 Secondary Color: Periwinkle 
The color periwinkle consists of a mixture between blue and violet. Since blue allows the calming sensation of the brain, the intention to incorporate blue was to encourage relaxation to iTourette users. Since the target users are children, pastel hue was emphasized as a common characteristic for all colors in the color scheme.

📌 LOGO
The first point of emphasis was the logo’s shape, which is a model of the basal ganglia. This is because Tourette Syndrome is an illness that is related to the body control movement (tics and involuntary actions), and the dysfunction is rooted in the brain’s basal ganglia. Similar to the curly shape that inverts to the center, emphasis was made to incorporate the brain anatomy into the icon. In addition, the color green was chosen for the basis of the shape because it is the primary color of the software. Mainly targeting children, the pastel green tone was used on a clean white background. There were two designs for the icon, the first one written in Korean (spelled out as iTourette) characters and the second one with the English alphabet. The first design was made in Korean, as the target users would be Korean children, but to launch an English version of the icon was designed to launch the application internationally.
